# jchat-server
Backend for my Chat application, JChat, done with Java, Spring Boot and WebSockets, using MySQL for the database.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Maven
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCOde, etc.)

### Getting Started

To run the chat application locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/AthirsonSilva/jchat-server
```

### Build the project using Maven:

``` 
mvn clean install
```

### Run the application:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will be accessible in localhost:8080, but you must run the [React frontend](https://github.com/AthirsonSilva/jchat-app) frontend in order to better interact with it.
